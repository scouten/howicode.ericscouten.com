= Use sentence case

Like many developers and documentation guidelines, I have chosen to use _sentence case_ consistently in most contexts.

The https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/capitalization[_Microsoft Writing Style Guide_ section on capitalization] has largely shaped my own thinking. I'll summarize a few of their key points, which I follow:

* Use sentence-style capitalization most of the time. That means the first word and proper nouns are capitalized; everything else is in lower case.
* Avoid the use of all upper case words for emphasis.
* Use title case for proper nouns (names of things).

As an example, I use title case for the name of this site, _How I Code,_ but the title for each page and the section headings within the pages are in sentence case.
