= Use complete sentences

When possible (and it's possible most of the time), write in complete sentences.

This applies in almost all contexts with a few specific adaptations.

== Comments

I almost always write comments in complete sentences with sentence-style punctuation.

.Comments in complete sentences
[source.prefer,rust]
----
// Recursively apply passthrough replacement and write the result.
let replacer = PassthroughRestoreReplacer(self.0, self.1);
----

.Comments not formatted as a sentence
[source.avoid,rust]
----
// recursively apply passthrough replacement and write the result
let replacer = PassthroughRestoreReplacer(self.0, self.1);
----

== Section titles and captions

(TO DO: Write about how these are sentence case, but without a period to end the sentence.)
