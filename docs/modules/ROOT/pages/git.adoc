= How I use Git

Like almost everybody these days, I keep my source code in https://git-scm.com[Git] (including https://github.com/scouten/howicode.ericscouten.com[this web site]).

Here are a few Git-related habits I've developed over time that work well for me:

== I like Conventional Commits

I've gotten into the habit of using https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional Commits] syntax in most of my projects.
It plays nicely with the release automation tools I use, and I find the structured format makes it easier to write good commit messages.

For commit titles, I follow the same approach I mentioned in xref:language/complete-sentences.adoc#exception-titles-and-captions[Titles and captions] -- they don't need to be complete sentences.

== I prefer squash commits

In most of my projects (websites are generally an exception), I do my work in pull requests.
I'm pretty heavy on automation (maybe I'll write about that someday), and PRs give me a chance to see how my changes will behave before they hit the `main` branch.

When I merge a pull request, I almost always use a squash commit.
Honestly, I find all those intermediate “fix typo” and “address review comments” commits just add noise to the history.

TIP: Don't worry -- GitHub keeps all those individual commits around even after you squash a pull request.
You can always un-delete the pull request branch if you need to dig into what happened during development.
I've found it reassuring to know that safety net exists, even though I've rarely needed to use it.

== Exceptions: When I don't squash

There are a few cases where I skip the squash and do a regular merge instead:

* Long-running maintenance or release branches that need to stay in sync with `main` -- those get merged with a merge commit to preserve the commit history and any release tags that might have been added along the way.
* When I'm pulling in commits from another project that I track over time, like in my https://github.com/scouten/asciidoc-parser[`asciidoc-parser` project] where I want to keep a clear connection to the upstream project.

== I keep source code and build artifacts separate

I've found it's cleaner to think of Git repos as being one of two things: either source code (the recipe) or the finished product (what I'm building) — but not both at once.
Whenever possible, I avoid setups where build artifacts get committed back into the same repo as the code that created them.

Take this website as an example: the https://github.com/scouten/howicode.ericscouten.com[GitHub repo] contains all of the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[Asciidoc] source files and the https://antora.org[Antora] configuration, but the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the live site? Those get built and published separately.
