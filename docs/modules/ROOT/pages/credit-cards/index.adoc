= Use credit cards wisely

Just as in real life, credit cards can make important things happen quickly -- but they can also create substantial ongoing costs if overused.

I don't believe there's a universally correct answer as to how much credit -- or, in this instance, *tech debt* -- is too little or too much, but I think it's wise to be _intentional_ about the tradeoffs you have to make in building any project.
There are cases where moving quickly makes sense and cases where being more deliberate makes sense.

I'll share my thoughts about some tech debt tradeoffs on the next few pages.
I tend to think mostly about how to build long-lasting, sustainable projects, but I'll note cases where one might make a different choice for a short-lived proof-of-concept project.
